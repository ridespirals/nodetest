        Deep beneath the earth there is no concern for the seasons above.
        Neither is there thought for night or day.  So is it that there is no
        measure for the passing hours as suffering takes its toll.  For those
        that lived under the mountain knew no end of pain that seemed to flow
        from the beginning of time to the end of an unforeseeable future.
        These were the years of bondage, but it is from such times that true
        heroism is born.

        "Forward you scum" shouted the fore-dwarf.  "I will have this coal
        piled before the diner bell."

        Silent curses filled the tight quarters of the mine shaft, rising in a
        thick sheet that it seemed only the fore-dwarf could see.  Enraged,
        the slave-driver whipped the men and boys that pulled the mine-cart
        on.  These miserable wretches are beginning to tire, thought the
        dwarf.  It was about time to liquidate them and go up top to get some
        more.

        The rock felt good in the young man’s hand.  It was cold and hard like
        his hatred for all things dwarven.  The little ones seemed oblivious
        to the fact that slaves like him had nothing left to lose.  In a
        matter of sunless days they would all be dead of exhaustion, but he
        had saved all that was left of his strength for one final act.

        "Allan," said the boy’s chain-neighbor.  "What are you doing?  If you
        resist, the dwarves will punish all of us."

        "Then you had best join me in slaughtering these bearded pigs," said
        Allan, "for I mean to breath fresh air."

        From the moment the last chip of stone fell from the statue, the
        crafts-dwarf knew he had created something special.  He had neither
        eaten nor sipped a glass of wine in almost a week.  When he put the
        marble bird on the shelf, he keeled over and promptly died.  No one
        found the body for a good long while, and after that the burrow was
        bricked up and condemned.  The bird just rested there, forgotten.  It
        could have been the end of our tale, hadn’t it been for a curious
        young man, and his passion for girls.

        The old dwarf fortress had been a boon for Talvis.  No one ventured to
        the abandoned mountain anymore.  Everything worth taking had been
        carried off long ago.  All that was left was the grim reminder of
        greed at its worst.  Talvis made a living dusting off old odds and
        ends and selling them at the trade depot downtown.  Most days he could
        find enough for a hot meal.  This time he would find much more.

        "What do we have here?" asked Talvis.

        Something sparkled in the torchlight.  It had taken Talvis over an
        hour to dig through the crumbling brick wall.  His hard work was about
        to pay off.  There, in a collapsed cabinet, was a glittering statue.
        Talvis took a rag and wiped away the dust and grim.  It was the most
        beautiful object it the world, and its adventure was just beginning.

        For a hundred years the bird passed from owner to owner, always laying
        by itself in a forgotten corner whilst the poor man or woman fell on
        hard times.  Inevitably, the owner would die after living out the last
        of their lives in hardship, and the bird would pass on to a new master
        after being found in the rubble or ashes of the ones who came before.

        “I have found it master,” said the groveling toady.  “The secret
        weapon we have been looking for.”

        The evil wizard Suffar had sent the creature to find the key to
        breaking into the dwarf fortress.  Suffar had sought this weapon for
        years and until this moment he had almost lost hope.  When Gromlin
        returned to the throne room, he held in his hands a marble bird.  The
        statuette itself was as beautiful as it was deadly, for whoever
        possessed it was doomed to misfortune.

        “You have done well, Gromlin,” said Suffar.  “Bring this cursed bird
        as a peace offering to the dwarves.  They can never guess the dark
        magic it contains.”

        Passing between the battle lines of the dwarf fortress was always
        tricky business.  The gremlin waited until a time between explosions
        and slipped into the darkness.  Slowly probing the dwarves’ defenses,
        he found a nearly unperceivable crack in the fortress wall and crawled
        under the gate.

        That morning the dwarf sentry looked out from the tower and saw that
        the enemy army had disappeared.  He ran down the tower steps, skipping
        two or three at a time.  When he reached the bottom, he saw the
        captain and another two officers handling a package.  One of them read
        from a note left with it.

        “My apologies,” read the dwarf.  “May this offering bring the fortune
        you rightly deserve.”

        “This has to be a trick,” said the royal adviser.  “Don’t be a fool.”

        Suddenly angered, the dwarven king ordered the adviser be brought to
        the hammerer for reprocessing.  He put his hands on the marble bird
        and sighed.  How had such a beautiful thing come into the hands of a
        villain like Suffar?  Why had he given it up so easily?  It hardly
        mattered now that the treasure was his.

        The bird rested in the secret treasure room of the fortress for nearly
        a decade before the killings started.  A miner here, a bar wench
        there.  No one felt safe anymore.  The sickest part was that no one
        could find the heads.  It wasn’t like the average berserker to take
        trophies like that.  The king was at a loss for ideas.

        “What do you have there?” asked Kogan, looking at his friend’s drawings.

        “It’s the bird I keep dreaming of,” said Aliz.  “Isn’t it beautiful?”

        That was when Aliz noticed the bloodstain on his palm.  He quickly
        pulled down his sleeve, hoping Kogan hadn’t noticed.

        “Isn't that the marble bird from the treasure room?” asked Kogan.

        “Quiet,” whispered Aliz.  “Someone might hear you.”

        The pair of dwarves looked at the treasure with awe.  It was a
        masterwork of craftdwarfship.  Kogan didn't know how or why Aliz had
        taken the thing from the king's private collection.  All he knew was
        he had to have it for his own.  As Aliz just stood there admiring the
        bird, Kogan slowly backed away.  Looking for the nearest weapon of
        opportunity, he found a chisel resting on the shelf of Aliz's chamber.
         Kogan took the thing and with one violet jerk, planted it into the
        base of Aliz's skull.

        The dwarven thief collapsed, killed instantly.  Kogan did what he
        could to clean up the scene of the crime.  He pushed the body
        underneath the bed.  It wouldn't be long before the corpse began to
        stink, but it would buy enough time for Kogan to escape with the
        prize.  He scooped up the bird and quickly made his way out of the
        dwarf fortress.
