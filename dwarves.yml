        Fighting in the streets.  Dwarves charged through the fleeing masses
        on their mules, striking out with chains and lances.  Up on the hill,
        the castle keep was on fire.  No one was left to resist but
        grey-haired men and young boys.  That was until Amawur arrived.

        The stranger was a span and a half tall, towering over man and dwarf.
        He carried with him only the bearskin than he wore, and an enormous
        log he used as a weapon.  A squadron of dwarves skidded to a halt
        before him.

        The head dwarf leaned over the saddle and spit.

        Watch where you step, slag," said the dwarf, "if you want to keep your head."

        Amawur looked at the dwarf as if sizing up how to bat a sloppy pitch.

        "It is you," he said, "who have failed to heed the warnings."

        Sailing through the air, the dwarf leader would have been embarrassed
        at his foolishness if he weren't dead.  Amawur worked his way through
        the rest of the squadron, beating the dwarves into the ground or
        slamming them into trees until they burst.  Utterly crushed, what was
        left of the dwarf army fled to the hills.

        "Mighty savior," said Old Father, "what reward is in our power to grant, just asked it."

        Amawur looked over the fawning villagers until he saw a woman that suited him.

        "Her," he said.

        But that is my son Ushav's wife," pleaded Old Father.

        Unwilling to hear any more whining, Amawur stepped to girl and grabbed
        her by her amber-colored hair.  She screamed as Amawur dragged her
        through the street.  Many villagers tore at their faces, so loved was
        the girl.

        "Don't take another step."

        Amawur looked down at the sissy before him. He looked about as
        fearsome as a baby goat with his horned helmet and red pants.  He knew
        of no one as lame in the entire world.  It could only be Ushav.

        "I will give you three seconds," said Amawur, "to get out of my way."

        "I will kill him!" cried Ushav.

        "Quiet," growled Old Father, looking over his shoulder.

        The young man winced as Old Father bound his broken arm.  He could
        still see Amawur's head as the giant disappeared behind the hill,
        Ushav's wife with him.  Ushav vowed to bring her back.  He vowed to
        strike the giant down.  But all in all it was a pathetic scene.

        "He will just break your other arm," said Aspa.

        The young woman, Aspa, was known for her strange ways.  She dressed as
        a man through most of her childhood.  She was known as the best horse
        archer in the barony.  Always hungry for glory, she had come to the
        village to fight the dwarves.  Now she saw the chance for a new quest.

        "I will join you on the quest for your lady," said Aspa.  "You have
        only to ask."

        Ushav opened his mouth, but Old Father spoke first.

        "Protect this boy," he said, "for he is as dear to me as the young woman."

        "Would you knock that off?!" screamed Ushav.

        Aspa put her reed flute away.  She watched as Ushav winced at every
        step his mule took.  It was going to be a long ride.  Amawur seemed
        never to take a rest as he bounded over field and stream.  Aspa
        wondered if he wouldn't lead them across the entirety of Allsphere,
        all the time with Ushav complaining.

        "I will make the giant pay for what he has done," said Ushav.

        "And what are you going to do?" asked Aspa.  "Talk him to death?"

        "How dare you!" shouted Ushav.

        Ushav screamed as an arrow struck the tree beside him, a hair from his
        nose.  Aspa leapt from her horse, brandishing her weapon, a long
        curved sword.  They were elves.  Aspa could tell, because if they had
        been kobolds they would already be dead.

        "What business have you in Animal Forest?" asked a haughty voice.

        "No one owns the wood," said Aspa.  "At least that's what I heard elves say."

        "Aspa!" shouted the elf emerging from the trees.

        Ushav rolled his eyes as the warrioress embraced her old friend.  This
        was just another obscenity in a long list of insults the young man had
        suffered.  The elves wee an obnoxious race of self righteous savages.
        Ushav looked at the dainty creature, clad in a tunic of leaves.  As
        Old Father said, trust an elf as you would a cornered snake.

        "Tell me, Aspa," said the elf, "who is your friend?"

        "This is Ushav," said Aspa with a grin.  "We are to slay the giant
        Amawur and rescue his woman."

        "I saw this giant," said the elf.  "He is headed toward Blackrock Mountain.  
        Because your quest is true, I will grant you passage through Animal Fortress.  Perhaps we will 
        even speed your way."

        The young man just about lost it as he was lifted onto the brown
        bear's back.  Aspa rode in the saddle in front of him.  With a click
        of her heels, the bear launched into a steady run.  Ushav closed his
        eyes and hugged Aspa tight with his one good arm.

        That night, they made a fire in the low hills just outside the forest.
        Aspa put the flute to her lips, but looked at Ushav and thought
        better.  He lay facing away from her and she could almost imagine him
        sobbing.

        "Does she really matter that much to you," asked Aspa, "that you would
        risk certain death?"

        "It is more than that," said Ushav.  "It is a question of honor."

        As her mind wandered close to sleep, Aspa imaged the fate of Ushav's
        woman.  Nine out of ten said she was already dead.  Worse still, the
        giant could make the poor girl its wife and she would bear its
        children if she didn't take her own life first.  No, she would not be
        saved.  This was merely a quest for vengeance.

        Ushav stirred.  The sun painted the sky a deep red.  Ushav knew then
        that his love was lost.  Slowly, he rose to his feet.  He walked
        through the fields of grass, though his mind was in a different place.
        That was when he found it, a cave in the middle of a low rising hill.

        "Ushav!" cried Aspa.

        How could she let him get away?  He had to be found before nightfall,
        for all manner of beasts roamed the countryside at night.  Luckily,
        his footprints suck out in the mud like great arrows pointing in his
        direction.

        When she found the cave, her heart sank.  He had entered the dwelling
        of a night troll.  The beast would find it hard to move during
        daylight hours, but in the darkness of the cave it could still be
        dangerous.  She called his name again.  There was only one recourse.
        Without another delay, she drew her sword.

        The bloated glowing eyes floated in the darkness above the bubbling
        cauldron.  Ushav stared into them as if in a trance.  That he was in
        the cave of some demon monster didn't even matter.  His love was gone.

        "Come closer young man," said the monster, "that I might feel the
        tender meat on your bones."

        "Have you eaten many men?" asked Ushav, his eyes fixing on the bloody cauldron.

        "Men?" asked the monster.  "Yes.  Dwarves too, though they are not desirable."

        "Have you ever eaten a woman?" asked Ushav.

        The monster looked confused.  It reached for a cleaver.  An arrow
        caught it in the neck.  Black blood squirted across Ushav's face.  A
        rough hand seized Ushav's shoulder and pulled him from the cave.
        Aspa's face was wild with fear.  Ushav took her hand and they
        disappeared into the growing evening shadow.

        "Do you want to die?" asked Aspa.

        The warrioress couldn't understand Ushav's pain.  The god of love had
        thus far spared Aspa his poison.  It was said that unanswered love
        turned men into beasts.  Aspa looked above the campfire into the
        eternal vault of sky.  There she saw a star spinning through the
        heavens.  Ushav was like that star, thought Aspa, unhooked from the
        wheel of sky that circled the earth.

        It snowed that night, and it was good.  For though it was a cold and
        miserable, Amawur’s foot prints were clear, and so were those of the
        woman he pulled along.  He was slowing.  Better still was the proof
        that she was still alive.  Aspa would try convince Ushav of this.

        "Are you not happy?"  pleaded Aspa.  "Then why do you look so sad?"

        "She is not whole," said Ushav.  "He will have broken off a piece of
        her soul and left it to die in the snow."

        "Then you will love what is left," shouted Aspa.  "Come, we are almost
        upon them."

        * * * * * * * * *

        The poor girl winced as the giant touched her hair.  Angered, the
        beast man spit and returned to his side of the campfire.  There he
        crossed his massive legs and leaned back against a straining pine
        tree.  His eyes never left the girl. The creepy gaze seemed to crawl
        over her skin and she was terrified.

        "You will learn to love me," said Amawur.  "I will teach you."

        Ushav’s woman had had enough of this. Her beauty had assured that she
        would never be free of the lust of ruffians as long as she remained
        young. That is why she loved Ushav, her poor husband.  But as he was
        gentle and kind, what man could save her now?

        "You will let that woman be," said Aspa, "or join the rest of your
        kind in hell."

        Amawur rose slowly, regarding the warrior before him.  She was rough,
        dressed as an outdoorsman.  With her was the pitiful Ushav himself.
        The giant chuckled.  It seemed the little man was persistent.

        "Old father gave me the girl freely," said Amawur.

        "She was not Old Father’s," said Aspa, "nor any man’s to give."

        "Nay," said the giant.  "She is that wimp’s woman.  He said so
        himself.  Let him come for her."

        "Maybe," said Aspa, "after I cut you down to his size."
